    <h1>Master Mobile UX Notes</h1>
  <p>Design for mobile first. The design philosophy is based on working with the weakest device first.
        The paradigm shifted from desktops to mobile devices.</p>
  <p>Developers used to design only for desktops. Now, we have desktops, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, watches, all of different screen sizes.
        Everything has to work within the boundaries of each device.</p>
  <p>“The simple guideline is, whatever you are doing, do mobile first.” – Eric Schmidt, Google.</p>
  <p>Desktop first tends to bring up issues. If desktop first leads to responsive retrofitting, then do it.
        But it is better to design for mobile as soon as possible.</p>
  <p>Going with mobile first plans for the future and prepares for growth.</p>
  <p>Things to remember:
    <ul>
      <li>Desktop computer sales have been declining since 2011</li>
      <li>You don’t see people with their heads in laptops; everyone’s head is in their phones</li>
      <li>Start small and scale up; start with the core functionality and content, and grow from there</li>
      <li>Mobile is NOT a fad; Phones aren’t going away</li>
    </ul>
  </p><br>

  <p>“It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” – Steve Jobs, Apple.</p>
  <p>Observe what people are doing and find a way to fill their needs as best as possible. 
        Be there. Be useful. Be quick.
  </p><br>

  <p>Reachability matters. 75% of people rely on thumbs. 49% use a one-handed grip. It’s easier for people to reach things on the bottom of a device’s screen. Key items must be in easy-to-reach places.</p>
  <p>Speed matters. Attention span is dwindling. Reduce images usage throughout sites/apps. SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwidth. Optimize and Minify CSS and JS files. GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data.</p>
  <p>Be friendly to users. Users that can reach important items on their apps are more satisfied.</p>
  <p>Placement matters. Addressing reachability issues creates a perception of speed, improves engagement rates, and increases user satisfaction.</p>
  <p>Understanding matters. Make sure people know what your interface is explaining.
        Perception matters. Keep up to date on latest trends.
  </p>
  <p>Give users a stellar experience from the get-go.</p><br>

  <p>Forms: Make it simple, so people can use it easily.</p>
  <p>Ditch side labels, place them inside input areas. When a user is inputting information, float the labels. Include progress bars. Enable autocomplete on your forms.</p>
  <p>Passwords: Show them at first, but give the user the ability to mask it at any time.</p>
  <p>Credit card info: Space the numbers and info apart automatically, and jump the cursor to the next input field. Remember to bring up the number pad when inputting numbers.</p>
  <p>Contact: Link phone numbers so users can simply tap the number to make the call. Consider adding a prompt to make sure they want to call, too.</p><br>
  
  <p>Before you advertise, research.</p>
  <p>Do NOT use pop-ups and in-between odds. Don’t make ads obnoxious. Make ads simple, and still make them effective. Don’t make ads full size to start with, but tapping on a smaller ad can lead to a bigger ad.</p>
  <p>Stop using pop-ups/pop-overs. Users don’t visit your website to look at ads. Keep it simple and sleek. Make sure it’s unobtrusive. Content first.</p>
  <p>“What would I personally think about this ad coming up in an article I was reading?” Empathy is key here.</p>
