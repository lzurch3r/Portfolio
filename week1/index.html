      <h3>Doing Stuff with Web Things</h3>
      <p>Where is “localStorage”? Does it come from the computer, or is it saved somewhere online?</p>
      <p>- When a user leaves or refreshes the page after storing information, any saved info will still be available.</p>
      <h4>Some review</h4>
      <p>When dealing with an input or textarea element in JS, use “value.” For a section, use “innerHTML.”</p>
      <p>Key-value pairs are used in JS often. Examples in real life are a person’s name(key) 
         and their contact phone/email address(value).</p>
